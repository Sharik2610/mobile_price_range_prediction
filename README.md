#In the competitive mobile phone market companies want
#to understand sales data of mobile phones and factors which drive the prices.
#The objective is to find out some relation between features of a mobile phone(eg:- RAM,
#Internal Memory, etc) and its selling price. In this problem, we do not have to predict the
#actual price but a price range indicating how high the price is.
#The Mobile Price Range Prediction Machine Learning (ML) model is designed to estimate the price category of mobile phones based on a set of features. This model is valuable for both consumers looking to make informed purchasing decisions and mobile manufacturers seeking to optimize pricing strategies.




#Key Components:

#Data Collection: The model relies on a diverse dataset of mobile phones, including their specifications, features, and corresponding price ranges. This data is essential for training and testing the model.

#Feature Selection: To build an accurate prediction model, relevant features are chosen from the dataset. These features may include processor speed, camera quality, storage capacity, brand, screen size, and more.

#Data Preprocessing: Data preprocessing involves handling missing values, feature scaling, and encoding categorical variables. It ensures that the data is in a suitable format for the ML model.

#Model Selection: The ML model selection depends on the problem's nature. Common choices include decision trees, random forests, support vector machines, or deep learning techniques like neural networks.

#Model Training: The selected model is trained using the preprocessed data. During training, the model learns to make predictions based on the input features and their relationship with mobile price ranges.

#Hyperparameter Tuning: Fine-tuning the model's hyperparameters is crucial for optimizing its predictive performance. Cross-validation techniques are often employed to find the best hyperparameters.

#Model Evaluation: The model's accuracy and performance are evaluated using evaluation metrics such as accuracy score,precision score,recall scores or f1 score . This step ensures the model's reliability and generalization to unseen data.


#Use Cases:

#Consumers: Mobile shoppers can use the model to estimate the price range of a mobile phone based on their desired features, aiding in purchase decisions.

#Mobile Manufacturers: Mobile manufacturers can leverage the model to optimize pricing strategies by understanding how different features impact pricing.
